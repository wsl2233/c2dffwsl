---yolov8-twoCSP-64.yaml---

Baseline model architecture configuration.

---C2DFF.yaml---

Network configuration for the proposed C2DFF-Net.

---block.py---

Implements the two core modules proposed in the paper: CDFIM and CGSA.
Both modules are designed to be plug-and-play, allowing for easy integration into other deep learning models with minimal modification.

---ALM.py

The proposed Adaptive Light-Aware Mask (ALM) method for training dual-modal models.

**Note:**

To align with the naming conventions used in the paper, the modules were renamed before the public release. If you encounter the following error when testing with our pretrained weights:
  
   Can't get attribute 'CPCA_CF' on <module 'ultralytics.nn.modules.block' ...
   
   Can't get attribute 'PolarizedSelfAttention_Channel' on <module 'ultralytics.nn.modules.block'

Please resolve it by renaming the modules as follows:
   
   Replace CDFIM with CPCA_CF

   Replace CGSA with PolarizedSelfAttention_Channel
